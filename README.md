In the future this should be an AI Agent to assist taking interviews.

You provide a Job Description.
The Agent will categorize the skills required in the JD.

With those categories the agent will suggest questions that you can ask during the interview.
The interviewer can ask all questions or not.

The agent also will provide suggested responses to those questios.

The interviewer during the interview will send the responses to the Agent.

The Agent will be saving those responses as a notes document.

When the interviewer completes the interview can ask for the report to send to HR.

The Agent will normalize the notes, search which question has a response and provide a question/answer list.

With that question/answer list, the agent will build a report to send to HR/Recruiters/Managers.

Tecnical features:
This should have an API and a console app.
